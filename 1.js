I have been getting a lot of traffic to my HTML5 sample video files post so I wanted to follow up with a general post that covers a multitude of sample files that are often needed in web development. I often also search for samples when testing and putting together different demos so I think this should be helpful to others. Below I will provide sample files for various image formats, video files, data structures, fonts, and even specific web development files.
